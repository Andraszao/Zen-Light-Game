# Interactive Zen Light Game
# from Zephyrus @ Inchworm Games
# Inspired by his life partner who impulse bought a light brite to bring joy to their neighbors.

This is a Godot project that creates an interactive grid where users can place colored lights to create patterns and ambiance. It features:

- **Drag-and-drop:**  Drag colored light pieces from a palette onto the grid.
- **Partially Working Backlighting:** Toggle a backlight effect to illuminate the placed lights.
- **Partially Working Color blending:** Adjacent lights subtly blend their colors.
- **Undo/Reset:** Undo mistakes or reset the entire grid.
- **Theme suggestions:**  Get random theme ideas, probably going to get rid of this.
- **Save/Load:** Save and load your light arrangements, needs testing.
